## Broken Access Control (A01:2021)
- Implement server-side access controls to prevent attackers from bypassing them.
- Use a centralized access control system and deny access by default.
- Log and alert on access control failures.

## Cryptographic Failures (A02:2021)
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit using strong cryptography.
- Use secure key management practices and avoid deprecated cryptographic functions.
- Implement secure password storage with strong, adaptive hashing functions.

## Injection (A03:2021)
- Use safe APIs and parameterized queries to avoid injections.
- Implement server-side input validation and escape special characters in queries.
- Use SQL controls to limit mass disclosure of records.

## Insecure Design (A04:2021)
- Establish a secure development lifecycle and involve security professionals early.
- Use threat modeling and secure design patterns in your application.
- Segregate application layers and implement plausibility checks at each tier.

## Security Misconfiguration (A05:2021)
- Use a repeatable hardening process to securely configure environments.
- Regularly update configurations as part of patch management.
- Implement automated configuration verification and security directives.

## Vulnerable and Outdated Components (A06:2021)
- Continuously monitor and inventory components for vulnerabilities.
- Use secure sources for obtaining components and ensure they are actively maintained.
- Remove unused dependencies to minimize attack surfaces.

## Identification and Authentication Failures (A07:2021)
- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) and avoid using default credentials.
- Use modern, evidence-based password policies and limit failed login attempts.
- Secure session management by generating new random session IDs and ensuring secure storage.

## Software and Data Integrity Failures (A08:2021)
- Use digital signatures to verify software and data integrity.
- Secure the CI/CD pipeline and implement review processes for code and configuration changes.
- Ensure serialized data is signed or encrypted to prevent tampering.

## Security Logging and Monitoring Failures (A09:2021)
- Log all access control failures and input validation issues with sufficient user context.
- Implement effective monitoring and alerting systems.
- Retain logs for delayed forensic analysis and establish an incident response plan.

## Server-Side Request Forgery (A10:2021)
- Sanitize and validate all client-supplied input data.
- Use positive allow lists to enforce URL schemas and destinations.
- Avoid using deny lists and disable HTTP redirections to mitigate SSRF attacks.
