This rule is triggered when any of the strings in the `names` array do not have
the specified capitalization. It can be used to enforce a standard letter case
for the names of projects and products.

For example, the language "JavaScript" is usually written with both the 'J' and
'S' capitalized - though sometimes the 's' or 'j' appear in lower-case. To
enforce the proper capitalization, specify the desired letter case in the
`names` array:

```json
[
    "JavaScript"
]
```

Set the `code_blocks` parameter to `false` to disable this rule for code blocks
and spans. Set the `html_elements` parameter to `false` to disable this rule
for HTML elements and attributes (such as when using a proper name as part of
a path for `a`/`href` or `img`/`src`).

Rationale: Incorrect capitalization of proper names is usually a mistake.
