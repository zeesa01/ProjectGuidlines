### Introduction
JavaScript is one of the most widely used programming languages, but with great power comes great responsibility. This guide provides best practices to secure your JavaScript code and applications.

### Input Validation and Sanitization
- **Client-side Validation:** Validate user inputs on the client side for better user experience, but never rely solely on it for security.
- **Server-side Validation:** Always enforce strict validation on the server side to prevent injection attacks.
- **Sanitize Inputs:** Use libraries like `DOMPurify` or `sanitize-html` to remove malicious code from user inputs.

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention
- **Escape Outputs:** Always escape data before inserting it into the DOM. Use `innerText` instead of `innerHTML` when possible.
- **Avoid `eval()`:** Never use `eval()` or `Function()` constructors with user inputs as they can execute arbitrary code.
- **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement CSP headers to prevent the execution of unauthorized scripts and reduce the impact of XSS attacks.

### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Prevention
- **Anti-CSRF Tokens:** Use CSRF tokens to protect against cross-site request forgery attacks. Ensure tokens are unique per request and user session.
- **SameSite Cookies:** Set the `SameSite` attribute on cookies to restrict them from being sent in cross-site requests, mitigating CSRF attacks.

### Secure Coding Practices
- **Use Strict Mode:** Always use JavaScript's strict mode (`'use strict';`) to catch common coding mistakes and unsafe actions.
- **Avoid Global Variables:** Minimize the use of global variables as they can be easily accessed and manipulated by malicious scripts.
- **Limit Third-Party Libraries:** Carefully evaluate and limit the use of third-party libraries, as they can introduce vulnerabilities.

### Handling Sensitive Data
- **Avoid Storing Sensitive Data in the Client:** Never store sensitive information such as passwords, tokens, or credit card details in the client-side JavaScript or localStorage.
- **Use Secure Storage:** If you must store data on the client, use secure and encrypted storage mechanisms.
- **Environment Variables:** Use environment variables for configuration and secrets. Ensure they are not exposed to the client or included in your codebase.

### Dependency Management
- **Regularly Update Dependencies:** Keep your dependencies up to date to ensure you have the latest security patches.
- **Use Lock Files:** Utilize `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock` to maintain consistency across environments and prevent dependency drift.
- **Security Audits:** Regularly run `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to identify and resolve vulnerabilities in your dependencies.

### Runtime Security
- **Use CSP and CORS:** Implement CSP and Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies to control which resources can be loaded and accessed by your application.
- **Sandboxing:** Use iframe sandboxing to isolate potentially untrusted content, limiting its ability to interact with the rest of the application.
- **Security Headers:** Set security-related HTTP headers such as `Strict-Transport-Security`, `X-Frame-Options`, and `X-Content-Type-Options`.

### Security Testing
- **Static Code Analysis:** Use static analysis tools like `ESLint` with security-focused plugins to identify potential vulnerabilities during development.
- **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** Implement DAST tools to test your application in a staging environment to uncover runtime vulnerabilities.
- **Penetration Testing:** Regularly conduct penetration testing to simulate attacks and identify security weaknesses in your application.

### Performance and Security
- **Minimize Attack Surface:** Reduce the size and complexity of your application by removing unused code and dependencies. This also improves performance.
- **Lazy Loading:** Implement lazy loading to defer the loading of JavaScript that is not immediately needed, reducing the risk of exposing unnecessary code to attacks.
