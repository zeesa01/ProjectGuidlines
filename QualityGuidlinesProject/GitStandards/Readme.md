### Introduction

A brief introduction to the project, its goals, and its primary use case.

### Features

- **Feature 1**: Description of feature 1.
- **Feature 2**: Description of feature 2.
- **Feature 3**: Description of feature 3.

### Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure Node.js is installed on your machine. [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Git**: Ensure Git is installed. [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/).
- **GitLab Account**: Sign up for GitLab if you haven't already.

### Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/username/repository.git
cd repository
```

### Install Dependencies

Install the necessary dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

Instructions on how to use the project, including examples and commands.

### Running the Application

Start the application with:

```bash
npm start
```

### Running Tests

Run tests with:

```bash
npm test
```

## Branching Strategy

We follow Git Flow for branching:

- **master**: The stable production branch.
- **develop**: The main development branch.
- **feature/\***: New features.
- **hotfix/\***: Immediate fixes for production issues.

### Creating a New Branch

Create a new feature branch:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! Follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`feature/your-feature-name`).
3. Make your changes.
4. Commit your changes with a descriptive message (`git commit -m 'Add new feature'`).
5. Push to your branch (`git push origin feature/your-feature-name`).
6. Open a Merge Request on GitLab.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details.

## DevOps with GitLab

### CI/CD Pipeline

This project leverages GitLab's CI/CD features to automate testing, building, and deploying code.

#### Pipeline Stages

1. **Test**: Executes unit and integration tests.
2. **Build**: Compiles the application and prepares artifacts.
3. **Deploy**: Deploys to staging or production environments.

### Example `.gitlab-ci.yml`

Below is an example of a GitLab CI/CD configuration file:

```yaml
stages:
  - test
  - build
  - deploy

variables:
  NODE_ENV: 'production'

test:
  stage: test
  script:
    - npm install
    - npm test
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - coverage/

build:
  stage: build
  script:
    - npm run build
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - dist/

deploy:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Deploying to production..."
    - npm run deploy
  only:
    - master
```

### Monitoring and Alerts

Utilize GitLabâ€™s monitoring tools to track the health of your applications post-deployment. Set up alerts to be notified of any issues in real-time.

### Continuous Security Integration

- **Dependency Scanning**: Automatically scan for vulnerabilities in dependencies.
- **Container Scanning**: Check Docker images for known vulnerabilities.
- **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**: Analyze your source code to detect security vulnerabilities.

These can be configured directly in your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file:

```yaml
include:
  - template: SAST.gitlab-ci.yml
  - template: Dependency-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml
  - template: Container-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml
```

## Security Best Practices

### Secrets Management

Use GitLab's CI/CD secret variables to manage sensitive data like API keys and passwords. Never hardcode secrets into your source code.

### Code Reviews

Implement mandatory code reviews for all Merge Requests (MRs) to ensure code quality and security standards are maintained.

### Branch Protection

Enable branch protection for `master` and other critical branches to prevent unauthorized or accidental changes.

### Security Audits

Regularly audit your repository and pipeline configurations to ensure compliance with security best practices.

## Git Hooks

Git hooks are used to enforce code quality and security checks before changes are committed or pushed.

### Example Pre-Commit Hook

This hook runs linting and tests before committing:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# Run linters
npm run lint

# Run tests
npm test

# Prevent commit if linters or tests fail
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "Linting or tests failed. Commit aborted."
  exit 1
fi
```

### Setting Up Hooks

Make your hook scripts executable:

```bash
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

## Software Tools

### GitLab CI/CD

- **Purpose**: Automates testing, building, and deploying your code.
- **Configuration**: Defined in `.gitlab-ci.yml`.

### SAST (Static Application Security Testing)

- **Purpose**: Detects vulnerabilities in your source code.
- **Integration**: Included via GitLab's SAST template.

### Dependency Scanning

- **Purpose**: Scans your project dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
- **Integration**: Configured through `.gitlab-ci.yml`.

### Git Hooks

- **Purpose**: Automatically run scripts before committing or pushing code.
- **Location**: Stored in the `.git/hooks/` directory.
