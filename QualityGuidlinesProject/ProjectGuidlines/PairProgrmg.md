Pair programming is an agile software development technique where two programmers work together. The goal of agile software development is to deliver software on an ongoing basis so the results can be evaluated more easily.

But how does having two programmers working together improve software development? Read on to learn more about pair programming, how it works, and its advantages and drawbacks.

## A Brief History

Some of the very first programmers were the women who worked on the ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer). These women worked in pairs, allowing them to discuss ideas and improve each other’s work.

Pair programming as a concept didn’t develop until the late 1990s, when agile software development practices were spread to a wider audience.

## How Does Pair Programming Work?

In pair programming, one person is the **“driver,”** and the other is the **“navigator.”** 

- **Driver:** The person at the keyboard who’s actively writing code.
- **Navigator:** Observes, checks code for accuracy, and keeps an eye on the bigger picture.

Pair programmers switch roles regularly, so both stay engaged. They also work collaboratively, determining which tasks need to be done.

## Why Use Pair Programming?

Pair programming is a great educational tool for beginners. Observing other programmers and writing code in front of them are excellent ways to improve problem-solving skills. It’s also a good introduction for programmers onboarding with a new company, helping them stay up-to-date with ongoing projects and preventing isolation from the team.

Christine Y., one of our Content Contributors, sheds more light on pair programming and how it’s beneficial:

> “I personally love pair programming because I prefer being on the exact same page as someone I’m working with. It creates less room for confusion/error, and I just think solutions are better as 2 minds > 1 mind.”

Pair programming requires communication to work effectively. It improves the quality of the code, as it’s reviewed by both programmers as it’s written.

Organizations that want to improve code quality, integrate new team members more smoothly, and foster a more collaborative development environment benefit from using pair programming.

## Advantages of Pair Programming

Here are some of the reasons why organizations use pair programming:

- **Knowledge Sharing:** Prevents key knowledge from being held by only a few individuals, reducing the impact of their absence and spreading expertise across the team.
- **Thinking:** Allows for brainstorming and bouncing ideas off each other, leading to more creative and faster solutions.
- **Focus:** Helps maintain concentration and freshness by switching roles and working collaboratively.
- **Accuracy:** Improves code accuracy with immediate quality checks, making it easier to catch issues and bugs early.

## Challenges of Pair Programming

While there are many advantages, pair programming also has its challenges:

- **More Complexity:** Tasks assigned to two people can be more complex, requiring careful planning and agreement on the approach.
- **Fatigue:** Working in pairs can be more tiring, so it’s important to discuss break schedules with your partner.
- **Managing Skill Levels:** Significant skill gaps between partners can lead to imbalances in workflow. Both partners should be open-minded and patient.
- **No Alone Time:** Some tasks require solo work. A consistent schedule that includes time for individual tasks can prevent burnout.

## Getting Started with Pair Programming

Many organizations use pair programming for improved efficiency. Even if you’re still learning to code, pair programming is a great way to enhance your skills. For example, if you’re new to Python, you might practice with another student learning Python (or someone more experienced).

If you’re taking one of our classes, consider connecting with other students in our forums or on Discord. Virtual pair programming, while having its hurdles compared to in-person sessions, can still be highly beneficial.
