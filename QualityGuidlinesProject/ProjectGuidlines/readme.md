[[_TOC_]]

### What are Proposals?

A proposal describes an initiative that can improve our engineering environment. These initiatives are technically agnostic, focusing on creating tools that support processes rather than specific implementations.

### Why Submit Proposals?

We aim to ensure that the ideas you submit are well-thought-out and comprehensive. Submitting a proposal demonstrates your commitment to the idea and your willingness to invest time in its research and development.

### How to Submit a Proposal?

Please [file an issue for a proposal](https://git.sinnerschrader.com/deven/project-proposals/-/issues/new) and use the provided issue template. Discussions can occur within the issues to clarify questions, add context, or iterate on the idea.
