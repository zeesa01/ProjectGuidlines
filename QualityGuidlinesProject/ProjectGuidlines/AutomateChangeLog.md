# Automating Change Log Updates in a CI/CD Pipeline

Automating change log updates in a CI/CD pipeline ensures that your documentation remains up-to-date and consistent with actual code changes. Here’s how you can achieve this:

## 1. Adopt a Conventional Commit Standard

- Use a commit message convention like [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) to ensure that commit messages are structured predictably.
- Example commit messages:
  - `feat: add user authentication module`
  - `fix: resolve issue with data validation`
  - `docs: update README with setup instructions`

## 2. Use a Changelog Generator

- Integrate a tool like [`standard-version`](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version), [`semantic-release`](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release), or [`conventional-changelog`](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog) in your pipeline. These tools can automatically generate a changelog based on commit messages that follow the Conventional Commits format.
- Example usage:
  - Run `npm run release` with `standard-version` to bump the version, generate the changelog, and create a new Git tag.

## 3. Integrate the Changelog Process into Your CI/CD Pipeline

- **Pre-release Stage:**
  - Add a step in your CI pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins) that runs the changelog generator before deploying or releasing new versions.
  - Ensure the changelog is updated and committed back to the repository. This can be done with a script that stages the changelog file, commits it, and optionally pushes it.

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions Workflow
name: Release

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Generate Changelog
        run: npm run release

      - name: Push changes
        run: |
          git config user.name "GitHub Action"
          git config user.email "action@github.com"
          git push --follow-tags
```

## 4. Versioning and Tagging

- Ensure your release process includes automated versioning (e.g., semantic versioning) and tagging. This helps in tracking the history of changes and aligning them with specific versions.

## 5. Review and Customize the Changelog Format

- Customize the changelog template if necessary to match your team’s needs. Most tools allow for configuration to include or exclude certain types of changes or to alter the format.

## 6. Automate Releases

- Use a tool like `semantic-release` to fully automate the release process. This tool can manage the entire process, from updating the changelog to publishing the new version and creating a GitHub release.

## 7. Maintain Branch Discipline

- Ensure that developers consistently follow commit conventions and branching strategies (e.g., feature branches, release branches) to avoid issues with automated changelog generation.

## 8. Monitor and Improve

- Regularly review the changelog for accuracy and completeness. Improve the automation as needed, and make sure the team is aware of the process and its benefits.

## Adapting the Process for Specific Tech Stacks

### Java Spring Boot

#### Adopt a Commit Message Standard

- Use a commit message convention like Conventional Commits to standardize your commit messages.

#### Use a Changelog Generator

- **For Java Projects:**
  - Tools like [`maven-changelog-plugin`](https://github.com/kongchen/maven-changelog-plugin) or [`semantic-release`](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) can be used to generate and manage changelogs.
  - `semantic-release` can be used with Java projects through its plugin for Maven or Gradle.

```xml
<!-- Example Maven configuration -->
<plugin>
  <groupId>com.github.eirslett</groupId>
  <artifactId>frontend-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>1.12.0</version>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <goals>
        <goal>install-node-and-npm</goal>
        <goal>npm</goal>
      </goals>
    </execution>
  </executions>
</plugin>
```

#### CI/CD Integration

- Add steps to your CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins) to run changelog generation commands.

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions Workflow for Java
name: Build and Release

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up JDK
        uses: actions/setup-java@v2
        with:
          java-version: '11'

      - name: Build with Maven
        run: mvn clean install

      - name: Generate Changelog
        run: mvn changelog:generate

      - name: Push changes
        run: |
          git config user.name "GitHub Action"
          git config user.email "action@github.com"
          git add CHANGELOG.md
          git commit -m "Update changelog"
          git push
```

### Angular

#### Adopt a Commit Message Standard

- Use Conventional Commits for your Angular project.

#### Use a Changelog Generator

- **For Angular Projects:**
  - Tools like [`standard-version`](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version) or [`semantic-release`](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) are often used. These tools can handle versioning and changelog generation based on commit messages.

```json
// Example package.json script for standard-version
"scripts": {
  "release": "standard-version"
}
```

#### CI/CD Integration

- Add steps to your CI/CD pipeline to run the changelog generation commands and push updates.

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions Workflow for Angular
name: Build and Release

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '16'

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Build Angular Project
        run: npm run build

      - name: Generate Changelog
        run: npm run release

      - name: Push changes
        run: |
          git config user.name "GitHub Action"
          git config user.email "action@github.com"
          git add CHANGELOG.md
          git commit -m "Update changelog"
          git push
```

## Common Steps Across Tech Stacks

- **Configure Versioning:** Use tools appropriate for your stack to handle versioning based on your commit messages.
- **Automate Changelog Generation:** Integrate the changelog generation and version bumping commands into your CI/CD pipeline.
- **Push Changelog Updates:** Ensure that changes to the changelog are committed and pushed back to your repository.

By following these steps, you'll create a consistent and automated changelog update process that aligns with your CI/CD pipeline, reducing manual effort and ensuring that your changelogs are always up-to-date with the latest code changes.
